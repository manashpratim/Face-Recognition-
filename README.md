# Face-Recognition
# Description

Implemented a ResNet50 architecture from scratch using PyTorch (and Keras) to classify and verify facial images using a training set of over 1.6M images. 

Achieved a test accuracy of over 74% and 92% on the classification and verification tasks respectively, convincingly beating the A cutoff of 72% and 90% respectively
